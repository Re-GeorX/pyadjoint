Tube shape-derivatives
======================

.. sectionauthor:: Simon W. Funke <simon@simula.no>, JÃ¸rgen Dokken <jdokken@simula.no>, Stephan Schmidt <stephan.schmidt@mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>

This example demonstrates how to compute shape-derivatives in morphing domains (including tube shape-derivatives)
using dolfin-adjoint.

Problem definition
******************

We consider the problem of computing the sensitivity of the goal functional $J$

.. math::
      \min_{u, \Omega(t), t<0<T} \ J(u, \Omega) := \int_{0}^{T} \int_{\Omega(t)} \nabla u : \nabla u~\textrm{d}x\textrm{d}t

where :math:`u` is the solution of the advection-diffusion equation in morphing domain:

.. math::
      u_t -k \Delta u - \nabla \cdot (u X_t) = 0  \qquad \mathrm{in}~\Omega(t)~\mathrm{for}~ 0<t<T

The advection velocity is the domain morphing velocity (i.e. the velocity of the mesh nodes) and denoted as :math:`X_t`.
In this example, the morphing domain  :math:`\Omega(t)` consists of a circle with a rotating cylindric hole.
Since this geometry is rotational symmetric, we can avoid for mesh-deformation methods by
creating a cylindric mesh with a hole and rotating the mesh over time:

We note at this point, that dolfin-adjoint is not restricted to rotational symmetric geometries, but also computes the shape-derivatives in more general cases.

On the boundaries of the outer and inner circles we enforce the conditions

.. math::
          u &= 1  \qquad \mathrm{on} \ \partial \Omega_{\textrm{inner}}~\mathrm{for}~ 0<t<T \\
          \nabla u \cdot n + u X_t \cdot n &= 0  \qquad \mathrm{on} \ \partial \Omega_{\textrm{outer}}~\mathrm{for}~ 0<t<T \\

The resulting shape gradient and state solution will look like this:

Implementation
**************

First, the :py:mod:`dolfin` and :py:mod:`dolfin_adjoint` modules are imported.
We also reduce the log level for convenience and import pprint for prettier printing.

::

  from dolfin import *
  from dolfin_adjoint import *
  from pprint import pprint
  set_log_level(LogLevel.ERROR)
  
Next, we load the mesh. The mesh was generated with gmsh; the source
files are in the mesh directory.

::

  fout = File("output/u.pvd")
  mesh = Mesh("mesh/cable1.xml")
  bdy_markers = MeshFunction("size_t", mesh, "mesh/cable1_facet_region.xml")
  original_mesh = Control(mesh)
  
Then, we define the discrete function spaces. A piecewise linear
approximation is a suitable choice for the the solution of the advection-diffusion equation.
In addition, we need a vector function space for the mesh deformations that describe the
mesh morphing at every timestep. For this, a piecewise linear finite element space
is the correct choice, since it has one degree of freedom at every mesh node.

::

  V = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)
  W = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)
  
Next we define some important model parameters

::

  k = Constant(0.01)       # Diffusion coefficient
  omega = Constant(0.25)  # Rotation velocity
  T = 4.0                 # Final time
  dt = Constant(0.01)     # Time-step
  N = int(T/float(dt))    # Number of timesteps
  J = 0                   # Objective functional
  
Next, we derive the weak variational form for computing the mesh coordinates
at every timestep. We consider a rotating domain, hence the mesh coordinates follow
the equation:

.. math::
    X_t = rot(X)

with the mesh coordinates :math:`X=(x, y)` and the rotational velocity
:math:`rot(X)=(2 \pi \omega y, -2 \pi \omega x)^T`

Discretising this equation with a Crank-Nicolson scheme in time yields:
Find :math:`S^n:=X^n-X^{n-1}` such that for all test functions :math:`z`

.. math::
    \left<S^n, z\right>_\Omega = \frac{1}{2} \Delta t (\left<rot(X^{n-1}+S^n)+rot(X^{n-1}), z\right>_\Omega),

where the super-scripts denote the timelevels.

In code, this becomes:

::

  s = TrialFunction(V)
  z = TestFunction(V)
  S = Function(V)
  X = SpatialCoordinate(mesh)
  rot = lambda y: 2*pi*omega*as_vector((y[1], -y[0]))
  F_s = lambda thn: inner(thn, z)*dx\
        - dt*0.5*inner(rot(X+thn)+rot(X), z)*dx
  
In the time-loop, the solution :math:`S^n` will be used to update the mesh coordinates for the next time-level.

Next, we derive the standard weak variational form for the diffusion-convection equation.
We integrate the diffusion and advection term by parts in order to weakly enforce the
boundary conditions on the outer circle. This yields: Find :math:`u` such that for all test
functions :math:`v`

.. math::
    \left<u_t, v\right>_\Omega + k \left<\nabla (u), \nabla (v)\right>_\Omega + \left<X_t u, \nabla v \right>_{\Omega} = 0

Discretising this equation in time using a Crank-Nicolson scheme yields the fully discretised problem:
Find :math:`u^n` such that for all test
functions :math:`v`

.. math::

    F_u(u^n, u^{n-1}, S^n;v) =&\  \frac{1}{\Delta t}\left<u^n-u^{n-1}, v\right>_\Omega \\
            &\ + k \left<\nabla u^{n+1/2}, \nabla v\right>_\Omega \\
            &\ + \left<X_t^{n+1/2} u^{n+1/2}, \nabla v \right>_{\Omega}
           =&\ 0

where the super-scripts denote the timelevel and the intermediate timelevels are defined as :math:`u^{n+1/2}:=\frac{1}{2} u^n + \frac{1}{2} u^{n-1}` and
the mesh morphing velocity at :math:`X_t` at the intermediate timestep is approximated as :math:`X_t^{n+1/2}=\frac{1}{2} X_t^n + \frac{1}{2} X_t^{n-1} \approx \frac{1}{2\Delta t} S^n + \frac{1}{2} rot(X)`.

In code, this becomes:

::

  u0 = Function(W)
  u1 = Function(W)
  v = TestFunction(W)
  w = TrialFunction(W)
  F_u = lambda V: (1.0/dt*(w-u0)*v*dx
                    + k*inner(grad(v),Constant(1/2)*(grad(w)+grad(u0)))*dx
                    + inner(Constant(1/2)*(w+u0)*V, grad(v))*dx)
  
Next, we define the Dirichlet boundary condition on the inner circle. The inner boundary edges are already marked
in the mesh, so this is achieved with:

::

  bc = DirichletBC(W, Constant(1.0), bdy_markers, 2)
  
  
Next, we define the set of deformation functions.
These functions will store the mesh coordinates changes
from one timestep to the next and will be solved
using the mesh deformation PDE above. Hence,
we need as many deformation functions as there are
timesteps in model (N). Later, we compute the derivative with respect
to these variables with dolfin-adjoint.

::

  thetas = [Function(V) for i in range(N+1)]
  
The mesh movement per time-step is decomposed into a static component (mesh rotation) and a dynamic component (the control variables in thetas).
The create a function which should contain the total movement per time-step, and assign the first control variable to it, assuming that the system starts from a static position.

::

  S_tot = [Function(V) for i in range(N+1)]
  S_tot[0].assign(thetas[0])
  
Now we can implement the timeloop. It consist of four main steps:

1. Solve the mesh deformation PDE to compute the changes in mesh coordinates. During the shape-derivative step and add the control variable to the movement.
2. Update the mesh coordinates (using `ALE.move`);
3. Solve the advection-diffusion PDE;
4. Compute the contribution to the objective functional.

The code is as follows:

::

  ALE.move(mesh, S_tot[0])
  
  for i in range(N):
      print("t=%.2f"%(float(i*dt)))
  
      # Solve for the fixed mesh displacement and assign this movement
      # summed with the control movement to the movement vector
      a, L = system(F_s(s))
      solve(a==L, S)
      S_tot[i+1].assign(S + thetas[i+1])
  
      # Move mesh
      ALE.move(mesh, S_tot[i+1])
  
  
      # Solve for state
      a, L = system(F_u(0.5/dt*(S_tot[i]+S_tot[i+1])))
      solve(a==L, u1, bc)
      u0.assign(u1)
      fout << u1
  
      # Compute functional
      J += assemble(dt*inner(grad(u1), grad(u1))*dx)
  
This concludes the forward model, and we can now focus on computing the shape derivatives.
As a first step, we define the control variables and the reduced functional. The control
variables are the mesh deformation functions for all timesteps:

::

  S_ctrls = thetas
  ctrls = [Control(s) for s in S_ctrls]
  Jhat = ReducedFunctional(J, ctrls)
  
Now, we can run a Taylor test to verify the correctness of the shape derivatives and shape Hessian that dolfin-adjoint
computes. The Taylor test performs a Taylor expansion in a user-specified perturbation direction.
Since we have N control functions, we also need to specify N perturbation directions:


::

  perbs = [project(0.01*Expression(["1-x[0]*x[0]-x[1]*x[1]", "1-x[0]*x[0]-x[1]*x[1]"], degree=2), V) for _ in ctrls]
  conv = taylor_to_dict(Jhat, S_ctrls, perbs)
  pprint(conv)
  
Finally, we store the shape derivative for visualisation:

::

  dJdm = Jhat.derivative()
  mesh.coordinates()[:] = original_mesh.data()
  
  output = File("output/dJdOmega.pvd")
  out = Function(V)
  for s, dj in zip(S_tot, dJdm):
      ALE.move(mesh, s)
      out.assign(dj)
      output << out
